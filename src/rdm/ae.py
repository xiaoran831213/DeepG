        dim: a 2-tuple of input/output dimensions
        dim[0] is the dimension of the input (visible units)

        ec_b: (optional) encoder bias of dimension d_2,
        by default the initial value is 0.

        ec_s: (optional) encoder nonlinearity. The default is Sigmoid.
        Specify 1 to disable nonlinearity
